# Quote

The quote component is implements in two variants. The first variant is the default `short` variant as inline quote with quotation marks. The second variant is the indented `long` variant. The indented variant is used to highlight a text passage or information visually.

Both variants can be extended with a `cite` element. The `cite` element is used to identify the source of a quotation and will be displayed below the quote as link.
